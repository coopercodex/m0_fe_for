# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  1. felt pretty confident
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  1. ive studied these concepts in the past so it came back pretty fast...still getting used to the git workflow. pretty good struggles today took breaks and came back to the problems
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  1. need to hone the skills better maybe through more practice
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  1. if i have any lingering questions i will ask my cohort mates and google!
